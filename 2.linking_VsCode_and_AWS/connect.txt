#Since writing IaC on plain text editor like vim, is not the best practice so instead we use Visual Studio code.
1. Install Vsc (mine windows)
#We wirte IaC on visual code and use providers like AWS to create resourceslike virtual machines, EBS, VPC, etc.

2. Go to AWS console and for best practice, create an IAM user with full admin and generate its access keys (save these keys). This user will be a programatic access user. 

3. Now take SSH to terraform server and run cmds, make sure you are using root user(sudo -i)- 
 mkdir terraform (can create anywhere)
 cd terraform
 vim provider.tf and paste - 
  provider "aws" {
   region     = "region-1"
   access_key = "access-key"
   secret_key = "secret-key"
 }
paste keys of IAM user created earlier and set your console region and save file.
run cmd-
 terraform init - After running this cmd terraform will look for providers file and will generate an api to connect to provider.

4. Now enable password based authentication for terraform server. goto - 
 vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set - 
 PasswordAuthentication yes
 PermitRootLogin yes

 vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf and set - 
 PasswordAuthentication yes

save file and run - 
 systemctl restart sshd

5. Now set password for root user, run - 
 passwd root and set strong password

6. goto terraform directory and run - 
 ls -la - to see hidden terraform files

7. Open VSC and install terraform plugin like HCL, terraform.

8. Now take through vsc , click open a remote window, connect to host, ssh root@server_ip, password, connect , press yes if asked and choose distros. 
9. Open folder /root/terraform(path to your terraform directory) - we can see providers.tf , open it
